# osv - Official Stats Visualiser

An Official Stats Visualiser capable of dynamic calculations of age-standardised rates, both internally and externally, across a range of population structures, stratifying for multiple sub-national geographic regions (RC, TLA, DHB), age through 5-year-agebands, various mortality causes including some definitions of amenable and avoidable mortality, year, ethnicity, gender, and deprivation index (from 2006). Following this one can choose to use techniques which aid in increasing sample size by grouping data to give perhaps more informative confidence intervals, alongside viewing a range of rate and relative rate graphs. These capabilities extend to projections, which can be gained from selecting the projection option and viewed as a series, and to b.y.o. data given the correct interface selections and data format.
